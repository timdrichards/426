# Course Structure

This page is a starter template for organizing course materials in a way that stays consistent week to week.

## Suggested information architecture

Use top-level docs pages for stable, semester-long information:

- Syllabus
- Calendar / schedule
- Assignment index
- Project overview
- Tooling setup

Use subfolders for time-based or topic-based content:

- `docs/weeks/week-01.md`
- `docs/weeks/week-02.md`
- `docs/labs/lab-01.md`
- `docs/projects/project-1.md`

## Working with repo assets

If lecture demos or code live outside the Docusaurus site (for example under `lectures/`), document them here and link to the relevant repository paths or files.

This keeps:

- source material and demos close to the code
- student-facing explanations centralized in the docs site
- updates easier to manage over the semester

## Baseline weekly page pattern

Use a repeated structure for each lecture/week page:

1. Learning goals
2. In-class agenda
3. Demo links / code references
4. Follow-up reading
5. Practice or homework pointers
