This page is the landing index for weekly lecture notes, demos, and references.

## Weekly lecture pages

Use the pages below as your semester lecture templates:

- [Week 01](./weeks/week-01)
- [Week 02](./weeks/week-02)
- [Week 03](./weeks/week-03)
- [Week 04](./weeks/week-04)
- [Week 05](./weeks/week-05)
- [Week 06](./weeks/week-06)
- [Week 07](./weeks/week-07)
- [Week 08](./weeks/week-08)
- [Week 09](./weeks/week-09)
- [Week 10](./weeks/week-10)
- [Week 11](./weeks/week-11)
- [Week 12](./weeks/week-12)
- [Week 13](./weeks/week-13)
- [Week 14](./weeks/week-14)

## Recommended workflow

1. Fill in the weekly page (`website/docs/weeks/week-XX.md`)
2. Link slides, notes, and demos for that week
3. Reference repo content in `lectures/` when applicable
4. Publish by pushing to `main`

## Linking to repo materials

If lecture demos live in `lectures/`, add links and a short summary inside each weekly page so students know what each folder contains and why it matters.
