# Lectures

This page is a landing index for lecture notes and demo references.

## Suggested organization options

1. One page per week (`docs/weeks/week-01.md`)
2. One page per lecture topic (`docs/lectures/docker-basics.md`)
3. Hybrid: weekly pages plus linked lab/demo pages

## Linking to repo materials

If lecture demos live in `lectures/`, add links and a short summary so students know what each folder contains.

Example structure to add later:

- Week 01: Course setup and environment
- Week 02: Containers and images
- Week 03: Networking and services
